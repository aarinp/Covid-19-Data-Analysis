# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-modeling-and-pridiction
The dataset is taken from JHU's GitHub repository. The software and packages which are used in this project are Jupter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Plotly.
This project is focussed majorly on analysing the data both on global and country level.
In country level drill down you will be asked for the country name of the country for which you want to get result.

From the provided Time Series DataSet, I am successfully able to derive active cases with the help of confirmed case dataset, deaths dataset and recovered case dataset.
While visualizing the data gathered from above datasest and newly created active cases dataset. I ploted a pie chart  of all the 4 dataset (used numeric data only) to plot it.
In the pie chart I discovered the fitality rate of Covid-19 Globally and Country wise.
